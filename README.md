Model Overview

This agent-based model simulates interactions between smallholder farmers, land use, and ecosystem services in a rural landscape of Eastern Madagascar. The model investigates how different agricultural practices and forest conservation levels affect food security, agricultural productivity, and biodiversity over time.
Key Features

    Agents: Represent individual farming households practicing shifting cultivation, lowland rice farming, or agroforestry.

    Landscape: A grid of 0.1-ha patches with land-use types and ecological properties (e.g. soil fertility, biodiversity).

    Processes: Annually simulated dynamics include population growth, land-use planning, agricultural production, harvesting with biotic and abiotic disruptions, foraging, fallow recovery, and nutritional assessments.

    Disruptions: Harvest losses from climate and pests are modeled stochastically using exponential distributions, modulated by ecosystem regulation services.

    Feedbacks: Farmers adapt decisions based on previous yields, forest conservation rules, and ecosystem service levels. Food security outcomes feed back into land-use decisions.

Purpose

The model helps explore trade-offs and synergies among biodiversity conservation, agricultural production, and human nutrition under varying conservation policies and farming strategies.
